I've now almost completed all the course work for my Data Science Bootcamp. If I could go back and give myself advice, here's what I'd say.



**1. Do something everyday**
It’s important to be regular in your learning. Your knowledge quickly builds on itself and accelerates. Even if you just spend a few minutes, that helps keep up the momentum. Unfortunately, this was an area where I fell off the wagon a couple of times. I learned from experience that even in the midst of chaos, if I applied myself for 20 minutes here and there, it made the ultimate job far easier.

**2. Expect the unexpected**
The bootcamp takes a long time, and over that time period a lot can happen. Unfortunately for me, this year was incredibly traumatic. Even before the pandemic I’d been through a lot – the death of a family member, death of a friend, losing my job … and then throw in coronavirus … kids at home, arrrgh. All that is to say that even best laid plans will at some point will go amiss. Be ready to make a pivot when necessary.

**3. Don’t discount what you already know**
Domain knowledge or what you already know about a problem is immensely important. Understanding what makes sense and what doesn’t before you begin, can save you a ton of time at the backend. If you think that the data looks weird, then it probably is weird. Take another look at how you got there.

**4. You’ll struggle with the labs … and that’s ok**
This will drive you absolutely crazy. You’ll read about a topic, then jump in ready to apply your knowledge, only to find that you have absolutely no idea what to do next. The gap in knowledge between the reading and the lab is just too great. It’s ok to struggle for a while, and then peak at the solution. Make sure that you type in the code and test how it works, rather than just cutting and pasting

**5. You’ll learn the most from doing projects**
Projects are absolutely the best way to learn. You’ll apply things that you’ve learned in the curriculum, but you’ll also need to do some further research. You’ll get stuck, eventually figure it out, only to get stuck again. You’ll get completely immersed in the problem and come up with solutions from unexpected places.

**6. Set a limit when working with models**
Tweaking models and get increasingly better results is fun … to a point. Don’t strive for perfection, because it doesn’t exist. Set a time frame for how long you’ll improve your models and then move on.

**7. Advanced topics are easy … but the background knowledge is hard**
You’ll be astounded at how simple the code is to implement a neural network. However, by this stage you will have already learned a lot. That background knowledge is important so that you can implement these techniques correctly.

**8. Some things seem impossible for a while**
Web scraping seems baffling at first, but once you get your first scraper working it feels like magic. Same thing with watching Machine Learning models or Neural Networks spin through tasks and epochs, getting better each time. You’ll be amazed. 

**9. Review what you’ve learned**
This is tough, because the curriculum marches on relentlessly. This is something that I wish I had done better. Save some time to go back and review a section after you’ve completed it. Spaced repetition helps with learning.

**10. Stay curious**
Of course, you wouldn’t be here if you weren’t curious. Having an end goal, and thinking up ways to implement your knowledge after you’ve completed the course work helps to keep you on task. You’ve got this.
